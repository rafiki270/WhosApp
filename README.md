Whoâ€™s App
=======

Repository contains submodule, please make sure you initialise it properly when cloning the project.

Time of dev: 4h

Space for improvements:
- Saving data / images to core data (possibly resizing thumbnails if the image exceeds certain size)
- Full TDD (I was unable to do any proper tests in a given 4h window)
- Use AFNetworking or NSUrlRequest to retrieve data
- Error handling
- Higher queue priorities for data (HTML)
- Unify GDC thread management to be handled from data source classes only
- Not using HTML! :)
